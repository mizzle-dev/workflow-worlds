# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repo](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:
1. Select which packages have changed
2. Choose the semver bump type (patch/minor/major)
3. Write a summary of the changes

The changeset will be saved as a markdown file in this directory. Commit this file with your PR.

## Releasing

When changesets are merged to main, a GitHub Action will automatically:
1. Create/update a "Release" PR that bumps versions and updates changelogs
2. When that PR is merged, publish the updated packages to npm
